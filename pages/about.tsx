            Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Anand</strong>, a full-stack developer based in
            India. I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether
            that be websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is
            to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4 font-medium">
            I believe that good application is not just about how it looks but
            also about how it works and how fast it loads. I work with keeping
            these things in mind.
          </p>
          <p className="font-medium">
            Whether I&apos;m working on a web app, mobile app, or a hybrid app,
            I always strive to build scalable products. I am always looking for
            opportunities to work with passionate people and exciting products.
